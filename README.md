## What is it?
- It's an app that connects a commuters with a rank managers regarding on whatever problem the commuters had with drivers
- The app is mostly focusing on solving reckless driving, a commuter has a power to get speed by calculation from one location to   the other and then post it so that the rank manager can see.
- To add up all the information we know for a fact that rank managers may not care about the driver speeding but we know that      police care, so this app could also help commuters to connect with the police.
