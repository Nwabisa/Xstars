 - He owns Langa taxi rank, he often get reports from commuters and when they have disciplinary meeting with the drivers it has       always been the commuter's word against the drivers.
 - He finds the whole thing confusing as he cannot actually come up with a solution because there is no proof that proves that      the commuter is right or the driver is guilty as charged.
